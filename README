           517 projectE219: Miscellaneous controller cleanup

************************************************************************************************************
We have modified some controllers, and add functional tests for controllers that we modified. (Please see
comments we wrote in code) All modifications are approved by Professor Gehringer. 

Because we don't change any front page functions, we didn't deploy our work on Heroku, which is also approved
by Professor Gehringer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controllers we have worked on:

1. pg_users_controller
2. popup_controller
3. profile_controller
4. publishing_controller
5. questions_controller
6. reports_controller
7. roles_controller
8. roles_permissions_controller
9. site_controllers_controller
10. statistics_controller
11. student_team_controller
12. suggestion_controller
13. survey_controller
14. survey_deployment_controller
15. survey_response_controller
16. system_settings_controller
17. teams_users_controller
18. tree_display_controller
19. users_controller
20. waitlists_controller

************************************************************************************************************
Modification on controllers we have done:

pg_users_controller

The class PgUsersController is inherited from UsersController. There are two methods "create" and "remove_user" 
in pg_users_controller.



These two methods are not called by any models or views. As a result, we think these code can be deleted.
This method creates an entry in the users table.  It is called from the Add Super-Admin, Add Administrator,
Add Instructor, and Add Student functions. The parent field identifies the entity in the users table (e.g.,
an instructor) that created this entry (e.g., a student).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
popup_controller

There are four methods, team_users_popup, participants_popup, view_review_scores_popup, and reviewer_details 
popup. Each one of them has its own view page. 

view_review_scores_popup is not called anywhere, so it can't be viewed. Other 3 methods are called by 
views/review_mapping/_report.html.erb. They can be viewed by 
http://localhost:3000/review_mapping/review_report/267(or 268).

In popup_controller.rb, we found that there are code duplications in team_users_popup and particapants_popup.
We merge the code into one function "getscore", and make two methods call the same function, this reduced a
lot of duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
profile_controller

There are two methods in profile_controller, "edit" and "update". They are called by view/profile/edit.html.erb
and can be viewed by http://localhost:3000/profile/edit.

Everything looks fine. We didn't modify anything.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
publishing_controller
 
There are four methods in publishing_controller, view, set_publish_permission, update_publish_permission, grant
and grant_with_private_key. view, set_publish_permission, update_publish_permission and grant are called by 
view/publishing/view.html.erb. grant_with_private_key is called by view/publishing/grant.html.erb. They can
be veiwed by http://localhost:3000/publishing/grant(view).

Everything looks fine. We didn't modify anything.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
questions_controller

There is no related view page, so I cannot decide whether I can move some methods into model. Some methods 
are called by questionnaire view page.

Method "SignupSheet" can be implemented in the method "list" because the code in them are exactly the same,
so SignupSheet can be deleted. Method "listuser" is not called by anywhere, it can also be deleted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
reports_controller

Only one method "view". It looks fine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
roles_controller

All methods in roles_controller are called by view pages of roles. It can be viewed by 
http://localhost:3000/roles/

I didn't modify anything.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
roles_permissions_controller

All methods are called by roles_permissions view pages. But these pages cannot be viewed. 

I didn't modify anything.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
site_controllers_controller

All methods are called by site_controllers_controller view pages. They can be viewed by 
http://localhost:3000/site_controllers/list

I didn't modify anything.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
statistics_controller

It can be viewed by http://localhost:3000/statistics/list, but the view_response and list_survey pages cannot 
display.

view_responses method inside code reuse! I defined cal_resopnse() for each calculation of responses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
student_team_controller

The method review is not called by any model or view pages. It can be deleted. Other methods are called by
student_team view pages, but the pages are broken, so they cannot be viewed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
suggestion_controller

All the method defined in the suggestion_controller are actions and has corresponding html file in the view 
or called in some of the html file. And it doesn't exhibit code redundant here, so we didn't modify it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
survey_controller

There is noting to change in the survey controller, only one method, assign, is defined in the controller, 
and it has the corresponding html file, however, in the view for the survey, there is also a file called 
list.html.erb, it is completely the same with assign.html.erb, so I think it could be deleted. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
survey_deployment_controller

(1).move the add method in survey_development_controller to the survey_development model. The method should 
not be in the controller, it doesn’t mean an action, and there is no corresponding html file in the view for
survey_development. 

(2).Make some code change:
i> @survey_deployment.course_evaluation_id = 27 (I'm not sure whether it's correct here to give the 
course-evaluation_id = 27, withouth given the value, error will be reported as there is no place that give 
the value for the variable course_evaluation_id)

ii>@course=Course.find_all_by_instructor_id(session[:user].id).map{|u|[u.name,   u.id] }, change u.title 
to u.name, there is no column called title in the table for course. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
survey_response_controller

We didn't find any redundant code here, so it's fine here and we didn't make any change. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
system_settings_controller

For system setting, the only change that should be done is perhaps to move the foreign method foreign to the
model of System Setting. However, I didn’t make the change here, the definition of the method foreign reduce 
the redundant of defining the same variables, so I thinks it’s proper here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
teams_users_controller

There is no redundant here and all the methods defined in the controller have corresponding html file in the 
view, they are all absolutely actions, so it's fine to define them in the controller. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tree_display_controller

I define a new method called goto_find(s) to reduce the redundant code in the controller.
  def goto_find(s)
    node_object = TreeFolder.find_by_name(s)
    session[:root] = FolderNode.find_by_node_object_id(node_object.id).id
    redirect_to :controller => 'tree_display', :action => 'list'
  end


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
users_controller

It's fine for users_controller. We didn't find any code redundant part. All the functions defined in the 
controller are actions and have corresponding html file in the view except two methods, get_role and foreign, 
however the two methods are private and protected, so we think it's ok to leave them in the controller and 
they also exhibit code reuse, so it's fine here. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
waitlists_controller

There is no change need to be done for the controller. 

************************************************************************************************************
We have added one functional test file for each controller that we modified, and one test case for each
method that we added, as shown in the code in test/functional folder.

All tests have passed.
